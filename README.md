# Room Sensor
This is a little weekend project I created to measure the temperature, humidity, pressure and lightlevel of a room with a wemos d1 mini and a bmp280 sensor. The data is stored in a firebase realtime database. And in the frontend folder is a angular webapp to display the data. You can see a demo here: https://iqwertz.github.io/RoomSensor/ .

The code currently isnt documented very well, but if you want to use it and have any questions, feel free to contact me at juliushussl@gmail.com.
